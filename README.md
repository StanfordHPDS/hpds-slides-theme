# HPDS Quarto Slide Format Theme

## Installing

```bash
quarto use template StanfordHPDS/hpds-slides-theme
```

This will install the extension and create an example `.qmd` file that you can use as a starting place for your slides.

See the example `.qmd` file for usage details and <https://github.com/StanfordHPDS/hpds_slides_example> (internal to HPDS) for an extended example.
